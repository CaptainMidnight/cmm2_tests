TEST PROGRAMS to WRITE:

* File interactions for High Score system - maybe make this an include
	- have options for: integer score, time score, larger=better or lower=better
	- display HS
	- capture and save HS

* multi-playfield background movement test

* sprite-sprite collision detection and overlay (the angles between them)
	- load in 2 sprites, set 1 in the middle of the screen, other is one I can control with JS
	- on collision, show the angle between them.
