Various little test and demo programs for the Color Maximite 2

Note: I'm using features that depend upon v5.05.04 RC4 or above. 

These are provided completely for free, and have no warranty or support. Most are just little tests I've written or found to try out different features of the language along the way as I make things. I try to include comments explaining things as much as possible.

Feel free to use anything you like, just please mention my name in your code or readme if you do use any of this.

Enjoy!
